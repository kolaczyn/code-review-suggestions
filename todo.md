# Suggestions to add:

- **how to write tests** - basically, test the app how the user/consumer uses it
- **TypeScript enums bad** - why you should use `const` object instead
- **prefer arrow function expression** (over the built in `function`)
- **handlers naming convetions** - `onClick` vs `handleClick` the first is the name of a component's prop, the second is the name of the function you pass as the props
- **direct listener vs useEffect** - if you need to handle an event, add an event listener. Don't use `useEffect` and create a Rube Goldberg machine
